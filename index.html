      <p>My name is Skylar Piper and I am an entreprenuer who know success does not come easily. 
        Growing up I always liked to do things with my hands; tinker, build, take apart, break, you name it. 
        My parents would tell you this never changed as I still tinker with everything. 
        But, to me its about figuring out how things work and finding a way to make them work better. </p>
